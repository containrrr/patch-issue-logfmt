**Describe the bug**
Things are broken yo

**To Reproduce**
Start watchtower (version 1.2.1) and get output:

```
2021-04-17T15:07:23+02 [D] 
2021-04-17T15:07:23+02 [T] created Shoutrrr URL from legacy notifier
                           URL: gotify://gotify.p1k.se/*******.*******?disabletls=No&priority=0&title=Watchtower+updates+on+Ketsueki
2021-04-17T15:07:23+02 [I] Watchtower v0.0.0-unknown
                           Using notifications: gotify
                           Checking all containers (except explicitly disabled with label)
                           Running a one time update.
2021-04-17T15:07:23+02 [D] Checking containers for updated images
2021-04-17T15:07:23+02 [D] Retrieving running containers
```

A docker compose file that is obviously not a log:

```
version: '3'

services:
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower:latest
    container_name: watchtower
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

**Expected behavior**
Things to not be broken
